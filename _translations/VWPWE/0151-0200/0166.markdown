** Teaser: First part of chapter **

NalanMoon waited for everyone to eat. GreenDew was forced by ThronyRose and FrozenBlood to her ‘death’. Once everyone went into shock, they began waking up one by one. However, one person wasn’t so fortunate. NalanMoon had triggered the death effect. While she was in shock, her health had been reduced to 0.

“Little Tian, resurrect her. Then she can eat again.” Ye Cang had endured the disgust. Looking at the dead NalanMoon, he felt much better.

Little Ye Tian nodded and began casting revive.

“Good thing I didn’t die...” GreenDew trembled. She began to image if she had been the one to kick the bucket, once she was resurrected, they would force her to eat again. ThornyRose and the others all nodded in agreement. Yea, just eating it once was more than enough! They each began trying to claw the taste out of their mouths. They felt even worse when they thought of the fact that deeper in, there were more human bones and other disgusting things.

BlackIce looked at Ye Cang. Her original despise turned into admiration and a bit of fear. This guy was not human...

NalanMoon slowly got up off the ground and saw Ye Cang’s concerned expression as he said: “Eat it again. We have a resurrection skill now, so there’s nothing to worry about...”

“...” Hearing his words, NalanMoon looked at the pot. Her whole body was instantly drenched in cold sweat.

“Are you afraid to?” CloudDragon raised an eyebrow and questioned.

NalanMoon furrowed her brows and looked at him. She became hot-headed, clenched her teeth to eat it again, and passed out once again in shock. Luckily, she wasn’t so unfortunate this time around.

“Bro, I feel like she definitely hates you now...” Zhang ZhengXiong murmured as he looked at NalanMoon’s twitching body.

“Hah~ This is all to train her psych. She’ll understand my earnest intentions...” Ye Cang sighed.

FrozenCloud, ThornyRose, BlackIce, VastSea and the others all rolled their eyes. *You were obviously just taking joy in her misfortune!!*

NalanMoon slowly woke up, and said with a cold face: “Let’s go...”
