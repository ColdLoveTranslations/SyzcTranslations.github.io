** Teaser... Sorta **

"Eh, can you not say something terrifying so easily..." Wu Na looked at Ye Cang's leisurely appearance and shot him a dirty glare, then thought of something. "Then does the east district have any guys like that who sound like they came straight out of a legend."

"Yeah, flasher uncle..." Ye Cang smiled.

"True... He really is a legend in the east district... There are already rumors like if you're surprise attacked by flasher uncle's elephant, you'll receive a week of good luck or something..." Wu Na covered her forehead and smiled bitterly.

LinHai North District, in some abandoned factory.

There were students, lovely women, businessmen, and bosses. Various occupations from various social classes all scheming against each other.

He recalled how his bones had been crushed one by one, restored, and then crushed once again. That endless torment, his face went pale just thinking about it and cold sweat covered his back. He looked at everyone and said in a cold voice: "Don't bring up it up again..."
