**Teaser (Sorta. It's just here to make it feel more complete.)**

“My…” NalanMoon stood up and stepped in front of him.

“Oh right. Lil’Dino! Come over here!!” Ye Cang turned and shouted towards FrozenCloud. He also got Little Ye Tian to come over too.

Ye Cang urged them a bit. The extremely happy Ye Tian and the helpless FrozenCloud pushed the handcart with a pile of equipment, entangling roots and thorns armor skillbooks, to go out and sell. They even set up a promotion. Buy one entangling roots skill book and receive a random Fine quality equipment. Buy two and get an Excellent quality equipment. According to Little Ye Tian’s scheme, since they have already squeezed all they could out of the rich people in the village. The rest of the players couldn’t afford it by themselves, therefore they used this method to encourage buying as a group.

NalanMoon saw that Ye Cang was trying to avoid the subject. Now she knew why ThornyRose always blew up on him. *This guy!* She reached out and grabbed his shoulder. “Mine!!!”

“Later I’ll give you 40 flame flasks. I’ll treat the money earlier as down payment...” Ye Cang patted her shoulder and said sincerely. 

NalanMoon’s chest tightened. She knew she wasn’t going to be getting that money back. She sighed deeply. *40 flame flasks was it? Well it was better than nothing.* “Contact me if there is anything...”

She quickly left, feeling upset.

Ye Cang shrugged, and then gave Zhang ZhengXiong all the crystals. He would be in charge of both embedding them and receiving payment. As for himself and Lin Le, they had been dragged away by ThornyRose and forced to make more flame flasks.
