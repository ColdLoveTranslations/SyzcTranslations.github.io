**Sneak Peak**

Ye Cang was currently sitting on a bench at the train station, drinking soda while waiting for his train. He sighed, took off his jacket, undid the buttons on the purple shirts sleeve, and ruffled his white hair. "That crazy woman owes me..."

He immediately thought of ways to threaten ThornyRose, and laughed evilly. Beside him on the bench was various local products including roast duck...

At quarter past 11, Ye Cang arrived back at the seaside cottage, saw the three of them playing on the sand, and smiled.. 

Lin Le saw the many packages of various sizes, and charged over desperately. "Brother Lil'White is back! Roast duck! Local products! Local specialties! Roast Duck!!"

Lin Le grabbed all the things in Ye Cang's hand and charged into the cottage. Ye Cang and Zhang ZhengXiong laughed, while Little Ye Tian glared. She had just been crushed in a game of Ludo last night...

"Let's go in first and get a bite to eat. The weekend is almost over..." Ye Cang smiled and walked towards the little cottage.

"Bro, you're dressed so formally. You look good. What happened at ThornyRose's place? Did you, you know..." Zhang ZhengXiong made a wily grin. 

"Let's talk as we walk. I only went to help her out..." Ye Cang said as he gave Little Ye Tian a hug, then smacked Zhang ZhengXiong on the back of the head. "What are you thinking about all day. However, their houses food is pretty good..."

The few of them chatted and laughed as they ate. Then entered the game.
