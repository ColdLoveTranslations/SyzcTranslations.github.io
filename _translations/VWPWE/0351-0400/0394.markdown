“Anos family...” Liu FengSheng felt a hint of fear. Hunting Flame’s meaning was clear, he wanted the Liu family to side with the extremists. From his understanding, the extremists were the 10 Commandments’ fangs, in charge of eradication, assassination, destruction. They were the strength faction, but the three of them were dangerous. Their leader was the mysterious Silver Devil. It was said that he was intending to retire and was cultivating new talents, but it seems like he is still a big shot among the Commandments. Cold Moon was the most frequently heard of out of the three extremists, with an extremely high danger rating. As for Hunting Flame, he acted in the shadows… His eyes narrowed, but being able to build relations with the 10 Commandments was still a fortunate thing, it just depended on how he used them. “RuYan, the matters related to the Commandments will be left to you. You have to handle it personally...”

“I know father.” MistyVeil nodded. She couldn’t be careless. If 10,000 Souls were mad dogs, then the extremist faction were mad lions, or beyond the level of beasts.
