Hey Everyone,

So I spent some of the donations to buy the VIP chapters. It only costed like 10$ for everything up to date (ch700+), which feels pretty cheep. Just thought I'd let everyone know where their donation money is going, as for the rest, it's being used to pay for disqus subscription.

I'm thinking of getting a domain name and maybe switching to wordpress (I hear it's free and can do comments so I can stop paying disqus).

Again, more chapters coming tomorrow.

Enjoy~~

Edit 2017-10-28: Busy with someone's birthday today. Will have to wait one more day.
