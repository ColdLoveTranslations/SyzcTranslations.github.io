Hey Everyone,

I realise I havn't posted in a few days, but don't worry, I have been diligently translating at least a chapter a day! And now we've reached into 3 digits!!! Next goal? To translate till they meet Wu Na!

Please take some time to answer this poll!

Also, a fellow reading - Tab has kindly volunteered to help me edit my chapters! He'll be starting from chapter 1 and working his way until he catches up, so I'll be periodically posting those fixes. He's already got a bunch of edits done, but I'm falling behind an havn't updated the site yet x.x. I'll also be giving credit to the people who have helped me spot my mistakes in those respective chapters once the editting gets to there, please email me if you would like to have your name removed. 

[Chapter 92][vwpwe0092]

Enjoy!
