Hello Everyone,

Sorry for taking so long, but I wanted to finish off the volcano part before releasing!

I also ask everyone to please put up with my going back and changing names and words as I go, since I am also learning more about the story and the game as well. I predict it will happen a lot in the future. Hopefully they take some time to explain the game more.

[Chapter 23][vwpwe0023]

Again, thank you to everyone who commented.
