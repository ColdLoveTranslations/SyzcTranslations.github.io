Hey everyone,

I just finished watching [Ancient Magus's Bride] recently (the first 12 episodes). I just want to gush over it a bit <3 I must say, holy crap, I love Lindel's singing voice, and that one quote he said during the song:

"Listen Closely to the sounds, to the song, to the sound of wind, to the sound of water. Humanity still remembers the sounds that filled our bodies from long ago, before even language itself."

Anyways, these chapters are the last ones in my stockpile. I'll be trying out working with some people who offered to edit, so hopefully that will increase the quality for everyone.

Enjoy~~
