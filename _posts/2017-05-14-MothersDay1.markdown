Hi again!

I'll probably continue doing batch releases of a couple chapters at a time because the chapters are really short. Also, I put off editting its not fun >.<

Anyways! It's mother's day so I'd like to thank my mom who always makes time to help me with parts I don't understand. She recently started reading Coiling Dragon (raws). It will be the first chinese webnovel we've both read!!

[Chapter 5][vwpwe0005]

Enjoy!
