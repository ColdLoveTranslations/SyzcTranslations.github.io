Hey Everyone,

With this releaes, the beginner village is finally over!! Boy did that take long. About 150 days or 5 months. Longest damn beginner village I've ever seen.

Since this feels like such an important moment in the story, I'd like to take some time to say: "Thank you everyone who donated or became patrons on my patreon. To be able to run this site the way I like it and translate without stress was all thanks to you. Also thank you to everyone who comments, it's always a pleasure reading what you all have to say and enjoying the story together."

Also, it's been a while, and my translation speed and release rate have changed so I'll be setting up this poll again. Would everyone like more frequent releases or continue like this releasing a batch of chapters about once a week?

Enjoy!!
