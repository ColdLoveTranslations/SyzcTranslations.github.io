Hey Everyone,

Here's the 50th chapter and it hasn't even been a month! Can you believe it? (jk, I know these chapter are really short). 

Since 50 seems like a good number, and I've proven to myself I have the motivation to continue translating, I've been thinking about trying to contact the author to get permission and whatever else I need to do to not get in trouble. So I will be spending a bit of time doing that. If anyone has any advice or experience with this sort of thing, please do help me out.

I've also considered trying to join a bigger group. What translation group's website do you enjoy reading from the most?

Anyways, here you go: [Chapter 41][vwpwe0041].

Enjoy!
