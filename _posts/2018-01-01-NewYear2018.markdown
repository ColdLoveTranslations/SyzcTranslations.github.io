Happy New Year~!

Hope everyone enjoyed their holiday!

Apologies, I took a little break from translating over the holidays. I'll start releasing again now that the new year has started. I have a few chapters translated so I'll just keep throwing them up as they are edited.

Also, if anyone is interrested in helping edit/proof-read/tlc or anything, feel free to email me at syc0308tw@gmail.com.

Edit: ok, thats it for today, I'll edit some more and reply to emails tomorrow. Night o/

Edit: 2018/01/02 more of the stockpile coming... I hard to edit while watching anime though xD

Enjoy!
