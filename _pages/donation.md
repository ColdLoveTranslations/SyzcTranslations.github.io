# Donation

Now accepting donations. Before donating, please read below.

Currently, I will not be providing anymore chapters in exchange for any donations. Nor am I providing any special privileges for patrons on patreon. These could be added in the future depending on how things go.

Donating will be purely for helping me to keep this website running (now have a 10$ disqus subscription) ad free. Any extra will be saved for future website maintenance costs and possibly towards getting a domain name. A portion of all donations will be saved up and will go towards the original author of the works I'm translating (whenever I figure out how to do that).

Please click below if you'd like to contribute a little :) Thanks <3
